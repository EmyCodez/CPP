Solution:
This method uses the concept that the area of a triangle can be decomposed
into the sum of areas of smaller triangles formed by the point in question and
the vertices of the triangle.

Let the coordinates of the three angles be (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3).
The coordinates of the given point P are (x, y). 

Calculate the area of ​​the given triangle, i.e. the area of ​​triangle ABC. 
Area A = [x1(y2 – y3) + x2(y3 – y1) + x3(y1-y2)]/2 
Calculate the area of ​​triangle PAB. We can use the same formula for this. Let this area be A1. 
Calculate the area of ​​triangle PBC. Let this area be A2. 
Calculate the area of ​​triangle PAC. Let this area be A3. 
If P lies inside the triangle, then A1 + A2 + A3 must equal A. 

Additionally, all individual areas must be positive (non-zero).

If any of the sub-areas is zero, the point lies on the edge of the triangle.
If the areas are non-negative but don't sum exactly to the area of the triangle, the point is outside the triangle.
